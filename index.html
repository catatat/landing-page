<!-- Font suggestion: Roboto.
- Add link to CSS after I finish boilerplate. 
- Edit `README.md` with brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.). Also image credits.
